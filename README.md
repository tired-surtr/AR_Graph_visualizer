# AR_Graph_visualizer
#This project's main focus is how can we harness AR/VR into our academical and educational streams, it is like a tool for acheiving one of the most important and ubiquitous problem with math in general, visualizing it and finding a meaning behind. 
#That has been  the problem for lot of students including myself.
#This acts as an application  that feeds on the complex equations and provide the learner with the visualization along with customization.

#Has pre-programmed functions ( basic functions that most students go through in their academic journey), and also versatile , allowing us to feed equations into it .
